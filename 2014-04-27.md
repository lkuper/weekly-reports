# Weekly report, week 17 of 2014

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

Finish and submit the SSS paper by Thursday UTC-12.

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

In fact, the SSS deadline was extended by a week -- so I did some work
on the paper, but also spent a lot of time working on !!Con.

Also, I got a job offer! :)

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

I was stuck for a while on what exactly I wanted the main theorem in
the SSS paper to even *say* (let alone how to prove it), but I at
least have a statement of the theorem and am making headway on the
cases now.
  
## (4) What is your plan for next week?

OK, let's try this again: finish and submit the SSS paper by Thursday
(actually Friday 7am).  Give to Ken to proofread ASAP.

## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

SSS deadline is Thursday!  Once that's done, I'll think about my
dissertation...
