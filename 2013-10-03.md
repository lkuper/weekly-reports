# Weekly report, week 40 of 2013

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?
	
  * Meet with Aaron Turon and Ilya Sergey to start talking
    about using LVars for CFAs.
	
  * Work on docs and testing for the lvish release.
	
  * Take a revision pass over our Freeze paper; start taking reviewer
    comments into account.

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

  * Aaron, Ilya and I met.  It seems promising...see below.
  	
  * I did lots of work on docs and assorted bugfixes for lvish (too
    many individual things to mention), and we did the lvish release
    yesterday! Yay!
	
	* Hackage: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lvish

	* Blog post:
	  http://composition.al/blog/2013/10/03/freeze-after-writing-will-appear-at-popl-2014/
	  
  * Most excitingly, our paper was accepted to POPL! :)
	
## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

  * Haven't started working on Freeze paper revisions yet.  We
    definitely need to spend some time on this next week, since the
    paper was accepted!
	
  * I'm concerned about various deep underlying lvish problems that
    cause intermittent test failures.  I'm also generally unhappy with
    the sloppy current testing situation for lvish (issue filed:
    https://github.com/iu-parfunc/lvars/issues/24), which I'm going to
    work on fixing because it's standing in the way of my
    understanding other problems.
  
## (4) What is your plan for next week?
	
  * Work on the Freeze paper revisions (meet with Aaron about this).

  * Make a CRDT reading list, read some papers, write to Marc Shapiro
    and Marek Zawirski.  (Context: Shapiro is one of the main people
    working on CRDTs -> he sent me pointers to four of his papers,
    three of whom had Zawirski as a coauthor -> Zawirski and some
    others now turn out to have a paper in POPL 2014 about CRDTs.
    It's all connected and this stuff may not be so far afield as I
    thought.)
	
  * Work on my RICON talk, which will also be my PL Fest talk for the
    25th. Get things sorted out for speaking at Mozilla while I'm out
    there for RICON.
	
  * Read the "Monadic Abstract Interpreters" paper
    (http://ilyasergey.net/papers/monalysis-pldi13.pdf), write to Ilya
    and probably Matt Might about CFA stuff, update them on where
    LVish stands and what they can do with it.
  
  * If I get tired of reading/writing, there's always more hacking to
    do on lvish.  Current issues assigned to me:
    https://github.com/iu-parfunc/lvars/issues/assigned/lkuper?state=open

## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

  * The Freeze paper revisions are pretty important.

  * The CRDT stuff will be a part of my RICON talk and, I hope, of my
    thesis proposal, which I need to sketch out soon.
