# Weekly report, week 28 of 2014

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

Try to move forward and work mostly on dissertation chapters 3 and 4,
but maybe also go back to the unfinished bits in chapters 1 and 2.

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

Lots of progress on chapter 3 of my diss, and some work on the
unfinished bits in chapters 1 and 2.  Latest draft, which is mostly
done up through chapter 3:
https://github.iu.edu/lkuper/dissertation/blob/master/diss/draft-07-12-2014.pdf?raw=true

Last week I wasn't sure how I wanted to organize chapters 3 and 4, but
after trying some things I'm pretty happy with the current
organization of chapter 3.  We'll see if things change as I write
chapter 4 next week.

Also, we found out that our paper didn't get into DISC. :( Too bad.
We didn't actually get the reviews back yet, though.

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

- The determinism proof in Chapter 2 and the quasi-determinism proof
  in Chapter 3 are still not done -- they both have the same missing
  piece.  I wrote to Neel a second time with the most recent status,
  and he wrote back with what I think will be a helpful suggestion,
  which is to split the operational semantics into two parts --
  essentially, the internally deterministic part and the internally
  nondeterministic part -- which allows for a cleaner factoring of the
  proof that will make it easier to fill in the missing piece.  I'm
  going to give this a shot.

- I still haven't gone back and added the missing "generalizing `put`
  and `get`" section in Chapter 2. I'm pretty sure what I want to do
  here; I just ran out of time for it.

## (4) What is your plan for next week?

- Work on the proof refactoring that Neel suggested; this will affect
  chapters 2 and 3.

- Get chapter 4 into readable shape.

- Work on the missing "generalizing `put` and `get`" section in
  Chapter 2.

My original plan was to be done with a draft up through
chapter 5 by Friday, but that's probably not feasible; up through
Chapter 4 is more realistic.

## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

My goal is to have a dissertation draft by mid-to-late July, then work
on the LVars JFP submission in August.
