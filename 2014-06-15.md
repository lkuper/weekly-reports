## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

Mostly hanging out at PLDI.  Back in Bloomington the 14th.

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

Lots of interesting conversations at PLDI!  My one-minute talk went
well!  (As did Ryan's talk.)

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

None.  (Except that the second leg of my flight home got cancelled
twice and delayed five times, but hey.)

Jumping back into dissertating.  This week I'm going to work on my
introduction and first content chapter.

## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

My goal is to have a dissertation draft by mid-July.
