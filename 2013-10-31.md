# Weekly report, week 44 of 2013

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

  * Submit my GED self-evaluation.

  * Attend a day-long Riak tutorial at RICON.

  * Work on my talk some more, speak at RICON Tuesday and
    Mozilla Thursday.
	
  * All week: talk with people at RICON!

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

All that stuff:

  * My notes from the Riak tutorial:
    https://github.com/lkuper/riak-notes
  
  * My RICON talk: begins around 01:11:45 in the recorded live stream,
    day 1, track one: http://ricon.io/west2013.html
	
  * Blog post that goes with the talk:

My Mozilla talk was similar (and not recorded).  I'll post the
slides soon.
	
## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

No problems to speak of.
  
## (4) What is your plan for next week?

  * On vacation doing family stuff (this is our Thanksgiving) today
    through the 6th.

  * Back in Bloomington the 7th-9th to get our POPL camera-ready out
    the door.  I'll also be able to work on it some while in Iowa with
    my family, but won't be online much.
	
  * Various post-RICON follow-up emails to send...
  
## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

After the 9th, I'm going to be working on my proposal and trying to
get a draft ready to send out by the 14th if at all possible.

I'm also tentatively thinking about a spring paper submission on
CRDTs+LVars and am investigating possible venues for such a paper.
