# Weekly report, week 15 of 2014

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

  * Work on proving the consistency property we want for threshold
    reads of CvRDTs; start sketching out the rest of the SSS paper.
    Explain what I'm working on to everyone at the group meeting on
    Friday.

  * Get my ExCAPE talk ready for Monday.

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

  * A fair amount of progress on the SSS paper -- still needs lots of
    work, though:
    https://github.com/iu-parfunc/lvish_papers/tree/master/sss14
	
  * I realized that we have to be more careful how we talk about
    termination, since programs with threshold reads may not
    terminate.  (This part is still in progress.)  This was actually a
    mistake in our WoDet paper.
	
  * Convinced myself that our "generalized threshold reads" example
    from the PLDI paper actually works, and wrote down what we need to
    require from threshold sets now.  I'm going to use this same
    example in the SSS section explaining LVars.
	
  * Got my ExCAPE talk ready to go for tomorrow.

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

No real issues at the moment.
  
## (4) What is your plan for next week?

  * Have a draft of the SSS paper done by the end of the week so I can
    ask for feedback.  This involves, among other things, writing a
    section of background on LVars that explains threshold reads.
	
  * ExCAPE talk tomorrow.
  
  * I'll hopefully also have some job-related news next week.

## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

SSS deadline is the 24th.
