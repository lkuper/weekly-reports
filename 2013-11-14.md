# Weekly report, week 46 of 2013

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

My plan was to finish up our POPL camera-ready by the due date on the
9th, then work on my thesis proposal and try to have a draft of it by
the 14th.

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

The above plan was thwarted when Ryan asked me to help out more on a
PLDI submission with him, Sam, and Aaron Todd, due the 15th, so after
the POPL camera-ready deadline I threw myself into working on that for
most of the week.  Submitted yesterday:

I also managed to fit in a quick blog post about CRDTs:

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

Because of the above, I haven't been able to work on my proposal
document at all, and so we decided to reschedule my proposal from
November 21 to December 6.
  
## (4) What is your plan for next week?

Starting on Monday I'm going to be working on my proposal document and
plan to have a draft to send out to my committee by Friday.
  
## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

I'm also tentatively thinking about a spring paper submission on
CRDTs+LVars and am investigating possible venues for such a paper.

I just found out that there's this new workshop on "Principles and
Practice of Eventual Consistency": http://eventos.fct.unl.pt/papec
It's talks-only, with a talk proposal due date of January 27.  I want
to submit something to that, but I'll think about other paper targets
too.
