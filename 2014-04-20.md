# Weekly report, week 16 of 2014

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?
  
  * Have a draft of the SSS paper done by the end of the week so I can
    ask for feedback.  This involves, among other things, writing a
    section of background on LVars that explains threshold reads.
	
  * ExCAPE talk  on Monday.

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

  * More progress on the SSS paper -- still need to actually finish
    the proof!:

  * Did my ExCAPE talk!  Will hear from them by the 30th.
  
  * Hung out with Trevor during his visit.

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

No problems, except constant low-level anxiety about jobs...
  
## (4) What is your plan for next week?

Finish and submit the SSS paper by Thursday (UTC-12).  Planning to
give it to ccshan to proofread in a day or two.

## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

SSS deadline is Thursday!  Once that's done, I'll think about (1) the
PLDI talk (which I guess will be me?), and (2) my dissertation...
