# Weekly report, week 51 of 2013

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

  * More work on AddRemoveSets.
  
  * Start on my WoDet submission -- bringing threshold reads to CRDTs,
    and maybe bringing CRDTs to LVish will fit in there too.
	
  * More job stuff, maybe.

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

  * I got AddRemoveSets working
    (https://github.com/iu-parfunc/lvars/commit/1638072), wrote more
    tests for them
    (https://github.com/iu-parfunc/lvars/commit/ee71b7f), and started
    sketching out PNCounters
    (https://github.com/iu-parfunc/lvars/commit/adc508b).
	
  * I got set up for our WoDet submission, although there's not much
	to it yet, just an abstract
	(https://github.iu.edu/lkuper/monotonic-data-structures/blob/master/wodet14/).

  * Still working on a blog post about verifying lattice properties
    for finite lattices.
	
  * Got a date set for visiting MSR: January 27th, the Monday after
    POPL.

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

  * We're getting some intermittent test failures on the AddRemoveSet
    tests I wrote.  I spent some time poking at it with Ryan on
    Wednesday with not much luck so far.  Issue open here:
    https://github.com/iu-parfunc/lvars/issues/58
  
## (4) What is your plan for next week?

Semi-vacation, but the WoDet deadline's in three weeks (and after
that, I have a POPL talk and an MSR talk to get ready for!) so I'll
probably spend some time on those things.  Also need to sort out POPL
travel.

## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

  * WoDet is due January 10; PaPEC (talks only:
    http://eventos.fct.unl.pt/papec/pages/welcome-papec) is due
    January 27.
