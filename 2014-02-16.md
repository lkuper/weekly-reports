# Weekly report, week 7 of 2014

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

  * Finish up our PLDI artifact on Monday.
  
  * More job search stuff: polish up my research statement, polish up
    our PLDI draft, put in my ExCAPE application.

  * Work on my WoDet camera-ready -- I think the claim I made about
    per-query consistency guarantees being novel wasn't true. :)
	
  * Arrange my WoDet travel.
	
  * Start doing all the Redex stuff I wanted to do last week.

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

  * We finished up and submitted the PLDI artifact Monday. Yay.
  
  * Set up Travis CI for the lvar-examples repo:
    https://travis-ci.org/lkuper/lvar-examples -- this was relatively
    painless, and seems a lot nicer than Jenkins!
  
  * Lots of work on my research statement. Got feedback from Vincent.
  
  * Made minor tweaks to our PLDI draft (just typos, basically); we
    definitely need to work more on it after the ICFP deadline.
	
  * Worked on my WoDet camera-ready -- I think it's basically done
    now.  Sorted out WoDet travel plans.

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

  * Put off submitting my ExCAPE application until I get more feedback
    on the research statement from people (i.e., Ryan and Sam! :) ).

  * Still haven't gotten around to Redexing. :(
  
## (4) What is your plan for next week?

  * Submit my ExCAPE application ASAP.
  
  * Help out with Praveen's WoDet camera-ready, due midnight tomorrow.
  
  * Work on my WoDet talk; do a practice talk at lab meeting Friday.
  
  * Finally do the Redexing I've been meaning to do for two weeks now.
  
## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

  * Job search stuff is part of my long-term plan of "get a job". :)

  * Redex stuff: `bump` would be part of the LVars/CRDTs paper (idea:
    CRDTs allow general inflationary writes, so why shouldn't we?).
    Same goes for modeling replicated objects.  The threshold function
    semantics thing is something I just ought to spend some time on to
    try to understand better anyway.
