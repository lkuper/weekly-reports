# Weekly report, week 20 of 2014

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

  * Finish up the proof for the DISC paper and get our DISC submission
    in on Thursday.

  * Leaving for NYC for !!Con on Thursday; will be gone until Monday
    the 19th.

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

Both of the above!  Submitted to DISC:
http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~lkuper/papers/threshold-queries-draft.pdf

I'm pretty happy with how it turned out; we'll see how DISC feels. As
a bonus, it's the first paper in which we describe generalized
threshold sets formally.

(!!Con turned out great, too. :) )

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

The main sticking point with the proof was to have a formal account of
the idea of "blocking" and the idea of "eventually", and I think we
now have both those things, thanks partly to advice from ccshan.
  
## (4) What is your plan for next week?

  (1) Write a dissertation outline, send it to my committee, see how
  everyone feels about me defending in late August. :)
  
  (2) Haskell Symposium reviews (I only have 6 to review).
  
  (3) Figure out what, if anything, I need to do before going to PLDI
  (get a one-minute presentation ready?).

## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

I think the main goal now is to work on my dissertation. :) I need to
figure out a timeline, but the outline will help.
