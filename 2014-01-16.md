# Weekly report, week 3 of 2014

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

  * Work on my POPL and MSR talks!  Do practice talks!
  
  * Work on our PLDI rebuttal starting the 16th (it's the 16th-20th).

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

  * Lots of progress made on my POPL talk.  My MSR talk still needs
    lots of work.
	
  * Ryan, Sam, and I met to work on our PLDI rebuttal (it was almost
    all Ryan) and will probably submit it next Monday night.
	
  * Added a ton of new stuff to the lvar-examples repo as a result of
    working on my talk:

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

No real problems, just need to be serious about working on my talks
the next couple days, which probably means skipping pre-POPL events.
  
## (4) What is your plan for next week?

  * Practice POPL talk at PL-wonks on Friday.
  
  * Actually go to POPL, do POPL-y things.
  
  * Work on my MSR talk a lot.
  
  * Practice POPL talks at POPL on Monday (meet with Ryan etc.) and
    Tuesday (meet with Neel etc.).
  
  * Give my talk Thursday.
  
## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

  * I'm in California for POPL, etc. the 20th-28th.

  * We need to figure out what deadline we want to try to hit for a
    longer paper on CRDTs.  If we go for ICFP, I'll basically just
    have February...would it be better to spend that time on
    potentially revising the Effect Zoo paper? (We'll know more after
    we get PLDI reviews.)
	
  * Back burner until after POPL: work on semantics for threshold
    functions, try to get something working in Redex.
