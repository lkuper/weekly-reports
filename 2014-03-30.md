# Weekly report, week 13 of 2014

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

I was on vacation (...ish) at Hacker School until Friday; since then
I've been working on our PLDI camera-ready due Monday.

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

See above. :)

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

I'm still confused about threshold functions and even "generalized
threshold sets" (lattice-variables post:
https://groups.google.com/d/msg/lattice-variables/Msa3RTEN3aY/RH5-LxGKsNoJ).
  
## (4) What is your plan for next week?

  * Finish up and submit our PLDI camera-ready on Monday.

  * Meeting with the ExCAPE folks on Friday, and before then I need to
    finish reading a couple of papers that Ras and Steve gave me and
    come up with an informal proposal for what I want to do.
	
  * Write back to Carlos Baquero answering his LVars questions from a
    couple weeks ago.
	
  * Go back to what I was last working on with adding "bump" to the
    lambdaLVish Redex model.  Bring questions to Ryan and Sam.
	
  * Maybe figure out what I want to do about an LVars/CvRDTs. I'm not
    so enthusiastic about threshold reads of CRDTs anymore; I don't
    know what they're good for, and I think it would end up just being
    an academic exercise (unless someone convinces me otherwise).  On
    the other hand, LVar-handler-style event-driven programming for
    CvRDTs sounds more interesting, so I need to figure out if
    anything like that is being done already.  Currently asking around
    (lattice-variables post:
    https://groups.google.com/d/msg/lattice-variables/09nhZZfVhdM/IAPwpC6veeIJ).

## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

  * PLDI camera-ready is kind of important. :)
  
  * The ExCAPE meeting is progress toward my  "get a job" goal. :)
  
  * Carlos is a potential collaborator for an LVars/CvRDTs paper and a
    good person to stay in contact with.
	
  * The "bump" stuff will be part of an eventual LVars/LVish journal
    paper and/or my dissertation.
	
  * This LVars/CvRDTs paper needs to get done sometime, somehow.
