# Weekly report, week 52 of 2013

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

Basically on vacation, but my plan was to work on one or more of 
{ WoDet submission, POPL talk, MSR talk }.

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

Well, I didn't do that, but I finally finished my monster blog post
about `asyncAnd`, and there's a pretty spirited discussion going on in
the comments:

I posted on lattice-variables about it:

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

None.
  
## (4) What is your plan for next week?

  * Get a rough draft of my WoDet submission done.
  
  * Try to sort out some of this `asyncAnd` stuff with Wren, if she
    has time.

## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

  * WoDet is due January 10; PaPEC (talks only:
    http://eventos.fct.unl.pt/papec/pages/welcome-papec) is due
    January 27.  PaPEC says: "We solicit proposals for contributed
    talks. We recommend preparing proposals of at most 2 pages, in
    either plain text or PDF format. However, we will accept longer
    proposals or submissions to other conferences, under the
    understanding that PC members are only expected to read the first
    two pages of such longer submissions."  So there's no reason not
    to send my WoDet submission to PaPEC too.
	
  * As soon as WoDet is over with (or sooner!) I need to work on my
    POPL talk and my MSR talk.
