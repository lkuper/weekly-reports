# Weekly report, week 39 of 2013

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

  * Finish up improvements to my talk, head to Boston, speak at FHPC,
    attend ICFP and talk about LVars with everyone!

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

  * The above. :)
  
    I overhauled my talk between the first practice talk (at IU) and
    the second (in the hotel room two hours before the talk), based on
    Ryan/Sam/Jeremy's advice, and turned it into much more of a
    Haskell talk.  It went really well!  Slides are here:

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

  * None! Except being exhausted from ICFP.
  
## (4) What is your plan for next week?

  * Tonight: meeting with Aaron Turon and Ilya Sergey to start talking
    about using LVars for CFAs (beyond what Ryan has already done).
    The question is, can we use LVars to parallelize and speed up the
    "Monadic Abstract Interpreters" work
    (http://ilyasergey.net/papers/monalysis-pldi13.pdf)?
	
  * Back in Bloomington next week: work on docs and testing for the
    upcoming (soon, we hope) lvish release.
	
  * Also, take a revision pass over our Freeze paper; start taking
    reviewer comments into account.

## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

  * The long-term plan is to come up with a "third chapter" about
    LVars.  For that, I want to pursue the CRDT thing, but I see no
    reason not to simultaneously pursue the
    LVars-for-monadic-abstract-interpreters thing. (This might be more
    of a middle-author thing for me.  We'll see.)

  * The lvish release and the Freeze paper revisions are both also
    pretty important.
