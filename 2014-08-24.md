# Weekly report, week 34 of 2014

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

Dig back into LVish; work on finishing up the still-unfinished proofs
in my dissertation.

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

This week I basically just worked on proofs.  I did the Chapter 3
Permutability proof (3.3), updated the Chapter 3 Monotonicity proof
(3.5), and did some work on updating the Independence proof (3.6)
until I got stuck.

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

I discovered that, as stated, the Independence proof won't go through
with generalized "update operations", i.e., "bump" operations.  I
emailed Ryan, Aaron, and Neel about it.  I think what we need is to
add an extra assumption to the proof, but I'm not sure yet.  My new
plan is to just go ahead and try to do the Chapter 3 Quasi-Confluence
proof (3.7), which uses Independence, and see what kind of property we
need to have hold and what will be true at the use site.  See my email
for details.

## (4) What is your plan for next week?

Keep working on the Independence and Quasi-Confluence proofs.  It
would be great to have the whole quasi-determinism proof done by the
end of the week.  My defense is in two weeks, so I should also start
putting a talk together at some point (although it will borrow a lot
from existing talks).  And *then* I can look at LVish again...

## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

It's on the critical path for finishing my dissertation and the JFP
paper.
