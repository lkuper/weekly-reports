# Weekly report, week 33 of 2014

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

Write a dissertation conclusion, turn in a draft, and start digging
back into LVish to try to understand some stuff better.

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

  * Wrote a conclusion!  Sent a draft to my committee!

  * Put my diss on github: https://github.com/lkuper/dissertation.
    Also, rigged up a pre-commit hook so that every time I commit, a
    new version is compiled and uploaded to
    http://www.cs.indiana.edu/%7Elkuper/papers/dissertation-draft-latest.pdf.
    Pretty soon I'll write a blog post inviting people to look at it.

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

No real problems, but I've been taking it relatively easy this week
and still haven't really started digging back into LVish, nor have I
been working on finishing up the still-unfinished proofs.  That's my
plan for next week.

## (4) What is your plan for next week?

See (3). :) Once I've made some more progress on all that, I'll catch
Aaron and Neel up on where I am, and together we can figure out what
needs to be done for JFP.

## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

It's on the critical path for finishing my dissertation and the JFP
paper.
