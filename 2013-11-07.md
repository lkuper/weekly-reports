# Weekly report, week 45 of 2013

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

  * Family vacation in Iowa the 1st-6th.

  * Back in Bloomington the 7th to get our POPL camera-ready (due the
    9th) out the door.
	
  * Various post-RICON follow-up emails to send.

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

Mostly done with our POPL camera-ready -- I got through sections 1-6
today and will do 7-9 tomorrow.

While in Iowa I caught on some, but not all, of my post-RICON mail.
	
## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

No problems to speak of.
  
## (4) What is your plan for next week?

Finishing up our POPL camera-ready in the next two days.  After that,
mostly working on my proposal.  I'm going to try to have a draft ready
to send out by the 14th.
  
## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

My proposal is the 21st!

I'm also tentatively thinking about a spring paper submission on
CRDTs+LVars and am investigating possible venues for such a paper.
