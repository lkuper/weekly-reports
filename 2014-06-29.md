# Weekly report, week 26 of 2014

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

My goal was to have a draft of chapters 1 and 2 of my dissertation to
send to my committee by Friday.

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

I'm already behind schedule, but got chapter 1 and the first two
sections of chapter 2 ready to send off:

(The other chapters are "there", but they're mostly just unedited
dumps of text from papers, and shouldn't be looked at yet!)

Of course, no one is under any obligation to look at any of this yet.
Just wanted to make you aware that I am doing something. :)

Also, I helped proofread Joel's FHPC submission.

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

The reason for the delay on chapter 2 is that I remembered that I'm
going to need to revisit the formalism from the first LVars paper so
that it's done in the style of what appeared in our POPL paper. And,
if I do that, I should really redo the determinism proof and the Redex
model as well. So, all that is on my plate for next week.

The good news is that if I do all that, then it's technically "new
material" and therefore suitable for the LVars JFP submission that
we've talked about.

## (4) What is your plan for next week?

Working on dissertation chapters 2 and 3.

## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

My goal is to have a dissertation draft by mid-to-late July, then work
on the LVars JFP submission in August.

Also, we find out about our DISC submission on July 12, and if that
gets in we'll need to get a camera-ready together by August 5.
