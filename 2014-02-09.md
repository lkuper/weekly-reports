# Weekly report, week 6 of 2014

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

  * Get a PLDI artifact ready: http://pldi14-aec.cs.brown.edu/

  * More job search stuff.

  * We hear back about the LVars/CRDTs WoDet paper tomorrow.
  
  * Cabalize and Jenkins-ify the lvar-examples repo.
  
  * Redex stuff I want to work on: semantics for threshold functions;
    semantics for `bump`.  Also maybe see about doing a Redex model
    for CRDTs -- that is, actually model replicated objects.

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

  * I've been working on our PLDI artifact (deadline tomorrow) with
    Ryan and Sam off and on since Thursday.  Mostly this has involved:
    working on Data.LVar.Counter; updating old code to use effect
    levels rather than determinism levels; and...
	
  * ...as part of the above effort, I finally cabalized the
    lvar-examples repo: https://github.com/lkuper/lvar-examples .
    Haven't hooked it up to Jenkins yet, though.
	
  * Our paper got into WoDet, yay!  Camera-ready due the 17th.
  
  * Job search stuff: There are a few more things I applied/want to
    apply to.  Let's talk about it after the artifact deadline.

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

  * Haven't done any Redexing at all.  Too busy with the PLDI artifact
    deadline.
  
## (4) What is your plan for next week?

  * Finish up our artifact on Monday.
  
  * More job search stuff: polish up my research statement, polish up
    our PLDI draft, put in my ExCAPE application.

  * Work on my WoDet camera-ready -- I think the claim I made about
    per-query consistency guarantees being novel wasn't true. :)
	
  * Arrange my WoDet travel.
	
  * Start doing all the Redex stuff I wanted to do last week.
  
## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

  * Job search stuff is part of my long-term plan of "get a job". :)

  * Redex stuff: `bump` would be part of the LVars/CRDTs paper (idea:
    CRDTs allow general inflationary writes, so why shouldn't we?).
    Same goes for modeling replicated objects.  The threshold function
    semantics thing is something I just ought to spend some time on to
    try to understand better anyway.
