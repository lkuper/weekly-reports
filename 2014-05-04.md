# Weekly report, week 18 of 2014

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

Finish and submit the SSS paper by Thursday (actually Friday 7am).
Give to Ken to proofread ASAP.

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

I got a draft of the SSS paper
(https://www.dropbox.com/s/bqu3j1hwlisrkie/sss11-draft.pdf) sent to
Ken and Sam (anyone who wants to take a look, feel free).  After
various conversations with them, we decided not to send it to SSS and
instead send it to DISC
(http://www.disc-conference.org/wp/disc2014/call-for-papers/), due May
15, which seems to be a better target and also gives us a little more
time to get the proof right.

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

Currently not happy with how I'm handling the notion of "blocking" in
the proof, but I think I know how to resolve it (see email thread with
Ken).  There are also a couple of other issues with the math in the
paper that Ken and I are discussing, but they aren't showstoppers.
  
## (4) What is your plan for next week?

  * Get the paper into good shape to submit to DISC: we need to cut it
    to 10 pages (*not* including references and appendices).  I
    promised to bring Ken a draft early in the week.  We're discussing
    it enough that I'm going to see if he wants co-authorship.

  * Work on a dissertation outline.

## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

DISC paper is due May 15.  After that, for the rest of May, I am (1)
going to NYC the 16th-19th for !!Con, (2) working on dissertation
stuff, and (3) probably doing reviewing for Haskell Symposium.
