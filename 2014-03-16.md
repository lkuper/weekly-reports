# Weekly report, week 11 of 2014

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

  * Work on my Intel Labs talk; practice talk at Wonks on Friday.

  * Work on our PLDI camera-ready.
  
  * More Redexing; figure out the right way to do `bump`.

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

  * Met with Ryan and Sam and made a plan for our PLDI camera-ready.
    Did some work on it; need to do some more.  (Also, we passed
    artifact evaluation, yay!)
	
  * Talked with Steve Z on Thursday about ExCAPE stuff.  He gave me
    some papers to read.
	
  * A lot of work on my Intel talk.  Got a ton of feedback from the
    practice talk on Friday.
	
  * I contacted Carlos Baquero and Marek Zawirski to see if they want
    to collaborate on adding threshold reads to C(v)RDTs.  Marek says
    he's overcommitted and can't do it.  Carlos and I are talking
    about it -- he hasn't said yes or no for sure yet but is asking me
    questions about LVars.

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

No problems.
  
## (4) What is your plan for next week?

  * Incorporate various suggestions into my Intel talk.  Figure out
    who I'm going to be speaking with there.
  
  * Read the paper(s) that Steve gave me
    (http://netdb.cis.upenn.edu/papers/lam-psnCor.pdf and perhaps also
    http://thinkinginmeta.com/Fan/pdf/metaprogramming_for_ocaml.pdf).
    Skype with him, Boon, and Ras on Wednesday.
	  
  * Finish up our PLDI camera-ready, due Thursday!

  * Headed to California on Thursday afternoon; interview Friday; back
    Saturday.
  
## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

  * The job talk is part of my long-term plan of "get a job". :)

  * PLDI camera-ready is also pretty important.
