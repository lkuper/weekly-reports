# Weekly report, week 30 of 2014

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

  * Dissertation stuff:
    - Keep working on the split-semantics proof refactoring.
    - Get chapter 4 into readable shape.
    - Work on the missing section in chapter 2.

  * Make minor changes to DISC paper and resubmit to OPODIS.

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

- I got lots done on the proof refactoring in Chapter 2: the
permutability and internal determinism proofs are done.  The next step
is to work on updating the strong local confluence proof.

- I did some more work on Chapter 4 as well, but it's still not done.

- I added a little new stuff to our DISC paper to address reviewer
  concerns, and resubmitted it to OPODIS.

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

I had to ask Neel some proof-related questions, which he answered.  In
chapter 4, the thing that slowed me down was trying to figure out how
to write about the stuff in LVish that has changed since the POPL
paper.  I ended up writing some new material and mixing in some stuff
from the PLDI paper.

## (4) What is your plan for next week?

I hope to finish the proof refactoring in chapter 2 and then apply the
same idea to the chapter 3 proof.  I'll also do more work on writing
chapter 4, and maybe will finally tackle the missing section of
chapter 2.

## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

My new plan is to push my defense date back to September 8 (everyone
has said they're OK with this except Amr) and my draft due date to
August 10, in two weeks.
