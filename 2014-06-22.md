# Weekly report, week 25 of 2014

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

Dissertating!  Working on chapters 1 and 2 (my introduction and first
content chapter).

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

Some good dissertation progress -- got everything dumped into a
template and am working on revising and rearranging.  Follow along at
https://github.iu.edu/lkuper/dissertation (only my committee has
access right now, but let me know if you want access).

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

No problems.
  
## (4) What is your plan for next week?

I'm in the bay area on a house hunting trip, but will also be working
while I'm here.  The goal is to have a draft of chapters 1 and 2 to
send to my committee by Friday (see below).

## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

My goal is to have a dissertation draft by mid-July.  This is my rough
timeline:

June 27 -- draft of chapters 1 and 2
July 4 -- draft of chapter 3
July 11 -- draft of chapter 4
July 18 -- draft of chapter 5
July 25 -- draft of chapters 6 and 7 (so, the complete draft)
