# Weekly report, week 32 of 2014

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

Dissertation stuff:

  * Finish the chapter 2 determinism proof refactoring

  * Write the rest of section 2.6
    ...which, if possible, will include a second, tweaked version of
    the chapter 2 determinism proof, which will be about a more
    general language -- but at this point I'd be happy to get just a
    single version of the proof done.

  * Redo the chapter 3 language in the same split-semantics style as
    chapter 2, and redo the chapter 3 quasi-determinism proof

  * Write the second half of chapter 4 (sections 4.2-4.5)

  * Write the conclusion (chapter 7)

  * And various little TODOs throughout.

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

Lots of dissertation work!

  * Chapter 2 proof refactoring is done, except for a couple of small
    pieces which should be straightforward.

  * Section 2.6 is done! (but doesn't include its own proof)

  * The Chapter 3 language is redone in the split-semantics style, and
    the proof rewrite is underway. (and should be straightforward,
    after doing Chapter 2)

  * The second half of chapter 4 is done! (modulo some TODOs)

  * Knocked off lots of little TODOs.  The only ones left are
    pertaining to the proofs and to chapter 4.

Got my defense announcement officially sent out, too!

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

Various small annoyances, but no showstoppers.

## (4) What is your plan for next week?

  * Tomorrow I need to write some kind of conclusion!  Once that's
    done, I'm going to turn in a draft and relax for a bit.

  * Then I'm going to start digging back into LVish to try to
    understand some stuff better (to improve Chapter 4).

## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

Draft to committee tomorrow.  After that, there will be some leftover
proof work to do, and some improvements to Chapter 4...and sooner or
later I need to figure out how all this will be turned into the JFP
paper.  Will get in touch with Aaron about that soon.
