# Weekly report, week 41 of 2013

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

  * Work on the Freeze paper revisions (meet with Aaron about this).

  * Make a CRDT reading list, read some papers, write to Marc Shapiro
    and Marek Zawirski.
	
  * Work on my RICON talk, which will also be my PL Fest talk for the
    25th. Get things sorted out for speaking at Mozilla while I'm out
    there for RICON.
	
  * Read the "Monadic Abstract Interpreters" paper
    (http://ilyasergey.net/papers/monalysis-pldi13.pdf), write to Ilya
    and probably Matt Might about CFA stuff, update them on where
    LVish stands and what they can do with it.
  
  * If I get tired of reading/writing, there's always more hacking to
    do on lvish.  Current issues assigned to me:
    https://github.com/iu-parfunc/lvars/issues/assigned/lkuper?state=open

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

In the order I did them, not order of importance:

  * I spent some time poking at the CFA app, and updated the open bug:
    https://github.com/iu-parfunc/lvars/issues/18
    
  * LVars were featured on LtU and I spent some time reading/writing
    comments there. :) http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/4823
    
  * I did a little editing of the Freeze paper:
    https://github.com/lkuper/sepdetpar/commit/9215195523b44deac4233b6beb44dcf786777c86
	
  * I read the "Specification, Verification, Optimality" paper (well,
    the first 4 sections of it -- it gets forbiddingly dense after
    that) and wrote to Marek (cc to lattice-variables list:
    https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/lattice-variables/lRV14YUtjr4).
    He wrote back and answered my questions, which was really useful!
	
  * I fixed the Jenkins lvish build that was breaking due to
    par-classes and par-transformers not being installed on the
    Jenkins machines.
	
  * I scheduled a talk at Mozilla for Halloween. :D Costume optional.
	
  * I finally made a CRDT reading list:
    http://www.citeulike.org/user/lindseykuper/tag/crdts/order/to_read,,
	
  * I started reading the CRDT survey ("A comprehensive study of
    Convergent and Commutative Replicated Data Types", 2011 TR by
    Shapiro et al.) and taking notes on it.
	
## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

No problems to speak of.
  
## (4) What is your plan for next week?

Basically just a continuation of what I didn't get done this week.

  * Finish reading the CRDT survey paper, maybe read one or two other
    papers from the list, and work on a blog post to try to synthesize
    all this.

  * Work on my RICON talk, which will also be my PL Fest talk for the
    25th, which I'm now also doing a version of at Mozilla on the 31st. :)

  * Read the "Monadic Abstract Interpreters" paper
    (http://ilyasergey.net/papers/monalysis-pldi13.pdf), write to Ilya
    and probably Matt Might about CFA stuff, update them on where
    LVish stands and what they can do with it.
  
## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

  * All this CRDT reading is towards a thesis proposal and the
    (three!) talks I have coming up.
	
  * The CFA stuff could lead to a paper too...
