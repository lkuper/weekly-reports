# Weekly report, week 38 of 2013

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

  * Incorporate feedback into my FHPC talk.

  * Get fhpc13 benchmarks running again, in one step.
	
  * Start learning about and cleaning up the LVish implementation.
	
  * Put some CRDT stuff on my reading pile.

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

  * I got lots of good feedback on my talk from Ryan, Sam, Jeremy, and
    others, and worked on incorporating it into my talk.  As a result
    of feedback from Sam, I decided that the code examples in the talk
    should actually be in Haskell. Hence
    https://github.com/lkuper/lvar-examples (and I'm also going to do
    a blog post about this, which is 90% done and which I'll post
    soon).
	  
  * I did a lot more digging around in lvish, and with Ryan's help,
    finished porting various LVars to use the new DeepFrz thing.  I am
    *gradually* coming to understand this code better.  Writing blog
    posts helps, too!  But there's still a lot about it that's opaque
    to me.
	  
  * I did lots of cleanup on the fhpc13-lvars stuff.  Too many commits
    to mention individually, but basically just cleaned up a lot of
    old cruft.

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

  * I wasn't sure how to go about porting the old "benchlist.txt" way
    of specifying what benchmarks to run over to use HSBencher.  Ryan
    and I worked on it this morning, but now I'm stuck again with an
    HSBencher issue.  Issue commented on:
    https://github.com/iu-parfunc/lvars/issues/6#issuecomment-24834566
	
  * Some of the fhpc13-lvars unit tests are failing and I'm not sure
    why.  :( Issue filed: https://github.com/iu-parfunc/lvars/issues/7

## (4) What is your plan for next week?

  * This weekend: finish up improvements to my talk, head to Boston on
    Sunday.

  * Will be at ICFP all week, speaking at FHPC on Monday! :)
  
  * Back burner stuff that I'd like to start on while at ICFP, but no
    promises:
	
	* Figure out parallel toposort with LVars like I've been meaning
      to do for a little while now.
	  
    * CRDT reading list.

## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

  * Going to conferences is important, duh.
