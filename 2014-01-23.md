## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

No problems, except that my MSR talk still needs work.

    paper.

## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

  * We still need to figure out a target for the LVars/CRDTs paper.
    ICFP is cutting it close...

    functions, try to get something working in Redex.
