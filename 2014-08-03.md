# Weekly report, week 31 of 2014

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

Dissertation stuff:

  * Finish the proof refactoring in chapter 2 and then apply the same
    idea to the chapter 3 proof

  * More work on writing chapter 4

  * Finally tackle section 2.6

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

I got a lot done, but it wasn't what I planned:

  * Got chapters 5 and 6 done. (!)

  * Wrote a big chunk of section 2.6 (the part on generalized
    threshold reads).

  * More work on the proof refactoring, mostly flailing around and
    asking Neel questions, but making some progress as well.

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

I'm still going back and forth with Neel about the proof.  Right now I
think I'm pretty close to having the key piece done in the chapter 2
determinism proof, but there are some annoying unsolved bits that I
can't figure out and am still asking for his help with.

## (4) What is your plan for next week?

I have a pretty long to-do list...

  *  Finish the chapter 2 determinism proof refactoring

  * Write the rest of section 2.6
    ...which, if possible, will include a second, tweaked version of
    the chapter 2 determinism proof, which will be about a more
    general language -- but at this point I'd be happy to get just a
    single version of the proof done.

  * Redo the chapter 3 language in the same split-semantics style as
    chapter 2, and redo the chapter 3 quasi-determinism proof

  * Write the second half of chapter 4 (sections 4.2-4.5)

  * Write the conclusion (chapter 7)

  * And various little TODOs throughout.

## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

I scheduled my defense for September 8, and one way or another I'll
have a draft out by Monday, August 11!
