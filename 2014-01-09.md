# Weekly report, week 2 of 2014

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

   * Get my WoDet submission done.

   * Think about asyncAnd some more.
   
   * Maybe start doing something with Naiad
     (http://bigdataatsvc.wordpress.com/2012/10/09/welcome-to-naiad/)?

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

  * Worked on my WoDet submission all week!  We turned it in yesterday
    and I think it's good as far as it goes:

  * More discussion in the asyncAnd thread, sorted some stuff out:
    https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/lattice-variables/bKCfOZ4Xhrs

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

I didn't get around to the Naiad stuff yet, and probably won't have
time in the near future, unfortunately.
  
## (4) What is your plan for next week?

  * Work on my POPL and MSR talks!  Do practice talks!
  
  * Work on our PLDI rebuttal starting the 16th (it's the 16th-20th).

## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

  * I'm in California for POPL, etc. the 20th-28th.

  * We need to figure out what deadline we want to try to hit for a
    longer paper on CRDTs.  If we go for ICFP, I'll basically just
    have February...would it be better to spend that time on
    potentially revising the Effect Zoo paper? (We'll know more after
    we get PLDI reviews.)
	
  * Back burner until after POPL: work on semantics for threshold
    functions, try to get something working in Redex.

  * I'm now thinking I don't want to submit a talk to PaPEC
    (http://eventos.fct.unl.pt/papec/pages/welcome-papec), since it's
    only a workshop talk and unfortunately I'm not sure it makes sense
    to go all the way to Europe for that.
