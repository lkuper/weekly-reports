# Weekly report, week 8 of 2014

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

  * Submit my ExCAPE application ASAP.
  
  * Help out with Praveen's WoDet camera-ready, due midnight tomorrow.
  
  * Work on my WoDet talk; do a practice talk at lab meeting Friday.
  
  * Finally do the Redexing I've been meaning to do for two weeks now.

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

  * ExCAPE application submitted!  Yay!
  
  * Went over Praveen's WoDet camera-ready.
  
  * Lots of work on my WoDet talk; haven't actually done a practice
    talk yet.
  
  * Also, I mentioned to Matt Might that I would be in SLC, and he
    invited me to come by and give a talk while I was in town, so I'm
    getting a talk ready for that, too.
	
  * Exciting news: I was asked to be on the Haskell Symposium PC.  :)

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

  * I realized my WoDet talk is way too long (20 minutes vs. 15) and
    it still needs to be mercilessly cut.  Trying to figure out how to
    do that.
  
## (4) What is your plan for next week?

  * Sam gave me his ICFP submission to read over; also there might be
    other ICFP submissions I promised to read?
  
  * Finish getting my WoDet talk ready.
    
  * Redex, dammit.
  
  * This isn't really research-related, but I promised to help out
    with various admitted-student-visit-days tasks, so I'll probably
    be busy with that Thursday/Friday.
  
  * Leaving for SLC on the 1st.
  
## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

  * Redex stuff: `bump` would be part of the LVars/CRDTs paper (idea:
    CRDTs allow general inflationary writes, so why shouldn't we?).
    Same goes for modeling replicated objects.  The threshold function
    semantics thing is something I just ought to spend some time on to
    try to understand better anyway.
