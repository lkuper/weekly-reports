# Weekly report, week 10 of 2014

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

  * Hang out at ASPLOS and go to talks Monday.

  * Give a talk at Utah on Tuesday.
  
  * More Redexing.
  
  * Back in Bloomington late Wednesday.  Ryan, Sam, and I should meet
    and talk about what we need to do for our PLDI camera-ready due
    the 20th.
  
  * Figure out if I really want to go for CONCUR.  The page limit is
	rather short, and the conference overlaps with ICFP... :/

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

  * ASPLOS!  Favorite talks: "Uncertain<T>", "Low-Level Detection of
    Language-Level Data Races with LARD".
	
  * Gave my talk at Utah on Tuesday!  It went really well.  Slides:

  * Got a plan made to visit Intel Labs on March 21st.

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

Kind of stuck in Redex on how to parameterize the model by a *family*
of `bump` operations.  Need to ask Sam or someone some questions about
this.

Still not sure what to do about CONCUR.  The true problem here is that
I'm getting a bit bored of LVars and would honestly rather graduate
sooner and move on to new and interesting things...
  
## (4) What is your plan for next week?

  * Practice my Intel Labs talk at Wonks on Friday.  I need to figure
    out whether I want to talk about the CRDT stuff, or if I want to
    instead try to incorporate the stuff from our PLDI paper...

  * Sam and Ryan and I need to make a plan and work on our PLDI
    camera-ready.
  
  * More Redexing; figure out the right way to do `bump`.
  
## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

  * The practice job talk is part of my long-term plan of "get a
    job". :)

  * PLDI camera-ready is also pretty important.

  * The Redex stuff is either for an eventual full LVars/CRDTs paper,
    or a journal version of our POPL paper...
