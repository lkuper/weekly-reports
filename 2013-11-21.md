# Weekly report, week 47 of 2013

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

My plan was to work on my thesis proposal document all week and have a
draft to send out to my committee by Friday.

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

  * As of right now, I have about 9 of an estimated 15 pages of my
    proposal written.  Still lots of stuff to fill in.

  * On Wednesday, Ryan and I sat down to try to work on some code to
    add to LVish for validating that the lattice properties hold for
    finite lattices (it's intractable to do this for infinite ones).
    It was easy enough to write a `verifyJoin` function that takes a
    join function as argument and checks that it is
    commutative/associative/idempotent (code is not yet checked in,
    oops; I'll do so when I am back on campus tomorrow); but when we
    did this we promptly discovered that the join function for the
    `parallelAnd` example from our PLDI submission isn't associative!
    Oops.  (Actually, the version appearing in the paper may be fine
    with regard to associativity but not fine with regard to the
    legality of the threshold set we use, which is why we were messing
    with it anyway; it is not clear how to be able to have both the
    "short-circuit" threshold we want and also have associativity.)
	
## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

  * The main thing is that we were surprised by the buggy join
    function and I'll have to revisit it next week.

  * I wrote to Russell Brown at Basho to ask some questions about what
    he thinks the applications for threshold reads for CRDTs would be
    (since he previously claimed that they'd be "very useful"), but
    haven't heard back yet.

  * I'm nervous about my proposal (I've never written a thesis
    proposal before!  What if I'm doing it wrong?!), but Ryan doesn't
    seem terribly worried, so I guess I shouldn't be, either...
  
## (4) What is your plan for next week?

  * I'll do by best to get the proposal done by tomorrow, although it
	might spill over into Saturday.

  * Go back and revisit the buggy join function (and things like it
    that I've tried to do in the past) and try to figure out a way to
    either have our cake and eat it too, or to prove that doing so is
    not possible.  (If short-circuit threshold sets and associativity
    of join aren't possible to have at the same time, then that might
    be the motivation I finally need to understand what the deal is
    with so-called "threshold functions" as a more general alternative
    to threshold sets.  I've always been very fuzzy on what threshold
    functions would mean formally and what properties would be
    required of them.)
	
  * Learn about dotted version vectors
    (http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.5808) so I can understand how CRDTs are
    implemented in Riak.

## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

  * My proposal is still scheduled for December 6.

  * I'm going to try targeting WoDet (http://wodet.cs.washington.edu/)
    for a paper about CRDTs+LVars (more details will be in my
    proposal) -- deadline of January 10.  This wouldn't preclude
    submitting a longer version to ICFP (deadline March 1) if it turns
    out I have enough to say on the topic.

  * There's also a new workshop on "Principles and Practice of
    Eventual Consistency" (http://eventos.fct.unl.pt/papec) that's
    talks-only, with a talk proposal due date of January 27.  I might
    submit something to this as well.
