# Weekly report, week 14 of 2014

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

  * Finish up and submit our PLDI camera-ready on Monday.

  * Meeting with the ExCAPE folks on Thursday -- before then, finish
    reading a couple of papers that Ras and Steve gave me and come up
    with an informal proposal for what I want to do.
	
  * Write back to Carlos Baquero answering his LVars questions from a
    couple weeks ago.
	
  * Go back to what I was last working on with adding "bump" to the
    lambdaLVish Redex model.  Bring questions to Ryan and Sam.
	
  * Maybe figure out what I want to do about LVars/CvRDTs.

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

  * PLDI camera-ready done (on Tuesday -- a day late).

  * Read a bunch of ExCAPE-related stuff, came up with an informal
    proposal, talked to ExCAPE people on Thursday, and got an
    interview scheduled for the 14th. :)
	
  * Wrote back to Carlos with answers to his questions.
  
  * Decided to go for SSS with an "adding threshold reads to CvRDTs"
    paper.

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

I didn't get back to the Redex bump stuff yet, and probably won't this
week.
  
## (4) What is your plan for next week?

All SSS paper, all the time:

  * Work on proving the consistency property we want for threshold
    reads of CvRDTs; start sketching out the rest of the paper.
	
  * I think I finally understand threshold functions better now, after
    all the work we did for the PLDI camera-ready.  So, maybe I can
    work this into the paper, instead of just talking about boring old
    threshold reads.
	
(I should work on my ExCAPE talk too, but I'll save that for the
weekend -- there shouldn't be that many changes to make to my existing
job talk.)

## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

SSS deadline is the 24th.
