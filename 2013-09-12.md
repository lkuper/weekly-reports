# Weekly report, week 37 of 2013

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

  * Prepare for and give a talk on Friday at pl-wonks.
	
  * Work on our POPL review rebuttal for the LVish paper!
	
  * Practice using the LVish implementation by implementing some more
    graph algorithms.

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

  * Got slides ready for my talk, which I'm giving tomorrow; the talk
    itself needs a bit more practice tomorrow.
	
  * Worked on our POPL review rebuttal!  Our reviews were quite good,
    so this hasn't been too stressful :)
  
  * Finally confronted my fear of the LVish implementation by:
  
      * ripping apart the whole project's directory structure and
        putting it back together in a way that makes sense to me, then
        patching up all the stuff that that broke
        (https://github.com/iu-parfunc/lvars/commit/63cf514246a3a092894fbf8d243f9a4c05932fd6)
		
	  * got the fhpc13 benchmarks code compiling again, and figured out
	    enough about Cabal to get fhpc13-lvars-benchmarks building as
	    its own package
	    (https://github.com/iu-parfunc/lvars/commit/db99aafd22cbf28e0f2ef5e783be6579b8d0e783)
		
    (I already feel much better about the whole thing, having finally
    started to use Cabal to manage the project (as weird as that
    sounds) -- my paralysis was not due to specific bits of code but
    more just lack of understanding of whole-project architecture)
   
  * Made a rough plan with Ryan that I want to propose in mid-to-late
    November.  I need a "third topic" (under the "three papers stapled
    together" model of what a dissertation is) and, roughly, what I
    want it to do is connect up LVars, CRDTs, and separation logic.
    This may or may not turn into some sort of "Distributed LVish"
    thing that may or may not connect up nicely with what Abhishek is
    working on.

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

  * I was confused about how to have targets for multiple executables
    from the same .cabal file; Ryan helped with this.
	
  * Didn't get as far as actually writing new LVish code, because I
    want to learn my way around the project, but I'm finally making
    headway on this and am excited about it!

## (4) What is your plan for next week?

  * Will probably need to incorporate feedback into my FHPC talk after
    pl-wonks tomorrow.

  * The fhpc13 benchmarks *build*, but I need to make sure that they
    still *run* properly; we should be able to do this in one step,
    and this will probably need to happen via make, rather than cabal.
    We have an old Makefile that needs to be brought up to date to do
    this.  Also, I want to move the old tests over from the
    lattice-par directory and try to get rid of all the build
    warnings!
	
  * Start actually asking Ryan and Aaron some questions about the new
    implementation and see if it's OK if I move stuff around (i.e., I
    see some old cruft that I think should be put under
    `Experimental`).
	
  * Put some CRDT stuff on my reading pile (but I probably won't get
    to reading it until after ICFP).

## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

  * Getting more comfortable with the LVish implementation can only
    help, and the fhpc part of the project is a controlled environment
    in which I can learn things like "help, how do I do this with
    cabal?"
  
  * CRDT reading is for my proposal (and my RICON talk in October).
