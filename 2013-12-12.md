# Weekly report, week 50 of 2013

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

  * LVish hacking!  Ryan pointed out that implementing 2P-Sets and
    PN-Counters should actually be really easy, and I should be able
    to knock it out pretty quickly.  We also have various other
    performance-related bug fixing to do; I'm not sure how much I can
    help with that, but we'll see.
  
  * Applying for a postdoc for which the application is due Wednesday!
    This mostly involves writing a short research statement and asking
    for recommendation letters.

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

  * I wrote a research statement, put in the postdoc application
    (thanks, Ryan, for writing a reference on very short notice) and
    asked for the other references I needed.
	
  * I read over Edward's Facebook Fellowship app for him.
  
  * I started sketching out 2P-Sets in LVish (I'm calling them
    AddRemoveSets:
    https://github.com/iu-parfunc/lvars/commit/aba571e8f,
    https://github.com/iu-parfunc/lvars/commit/024c155bb) and asked
    Ryan a bunch of questions.
	
  * Started on a blog post about verifying lattice properties for
    finite lattices -- not done yet.

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

In my personal life, I had a bad week (our house was burglarized and
our cat needed emergency surgery!) which was bad for my
productivity. :(

While working on AddRemoveSets, I realized I'd need freezing in order
to write any interesting tests, and that therefore I'll have to think
about what it means to freeze them.  I think that, for the semantics
to match usual LVar freezing, then after a freeze you ought to still
be able to remove already-removed elements and add already-added
elements without raising an exception.

I continue to be sort of confused about the testing and building
scenario for LVish (what are the criteria for a successful build?
shouldn't there be one agreed-on way of doing a build?), but after
talking to Ryan, at least it's no longer blocking my progress.

## (4) What is your plan for next week?

  * More work on AddRemoveSets.
  
  * Start on my WoDet submission -- bringing threshold reads to CRDTs,
    and maybe bringing CRDTs to LVish will fit in there too.
	
  * More job stuff, maybe.

## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

  * WoDet is due January 10; PaPEC (talks only:
    http://eventos.fct.unl.pt/papec/pages/welcome-papec) is due
    January 27.
