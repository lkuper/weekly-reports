# Weekly report, week 49 of 2013

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

Out of town volunteering at Hacker School all week; not planning to
get much done wrt research, except maybe a blog post.

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

TODO:

  * update existing CRDT blog post to reflect current thinking
  
  * write a new CRDT blog post OR write the next post in my Haskell
    'aw' series
	
  * some kind of Rust 0.9 contribution
	
I have to get *some* new blog post done today, so I guess I'll work on
the 'aw' post.  That'll be useful for my week at HS, too.

Also, I need to make the slides for my proposal presentation.

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

...TODO...

## (4) What is your plan for next week?

...TODO...

## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

  * My proposal is still scheduled for December 6.

  * I'm going to try targeting WoDet (http://wodet.cs.washington.edu/)
    for a paper about CRDTs+LVars (more details will be in my
    proposal) -- deadline of January 10.  This wouldn't preclude
    submitting a longer version to ICFP (deadline March 1) if it turns
    out I have enough to say on the topic.

  * There's also a new workshop on "Principles and Practice of
    Eventual Consistency" (http://eventos.fct.unl.pt/papec) that's
    talks-only, with a talk proposal due date of January 27.  I might
    submit something to this as well.
