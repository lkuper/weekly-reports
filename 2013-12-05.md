# Weekly report, week 49 of 2013

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

Out of town volunteering at Hacker School all week; the only research
tasks on my plate were working on slides for my proposal presentation
and perhaps a blog post.

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

  * I updated my previous blog post on CRDTs and threshold reads to
    reflect current thinking:
    http://composition.al/blog/2013/11/11/thoughts-on-crdts-and-threshold-reads/
  
  * Finished up the slides for my proposal (and successfully proposed
    on Friday, woo!).  (Final version of proposal:

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

No problems, except that we had to drive home in the middle of the
night on Thursday in a snowstorm, and the storm continued into the
following morning and made half my committee late for my
proposal...but no harm done. :)

## (4) What is your plan for next week?

  * LVish hacking!
  
  * Applying for a postdoc for which the application is due Wednesday!
    This mostly involves writing a short research statement and asking
    for recommendation letters.

## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

  * I'm going to try targeting WoDet (http://wodet.cs.washington.edu/)
    for a paper about CRDTs+LVars (more details will be in my
    proposal) -- deadline of January 10.  This wouldn't preclude
    submitting a longer version to ICFP (deadline March 1) if it turns
    out I have enough to say on the topic.

  * There's also a new workshop on "Principles and Practice of
    Eventual Consistency" (http://eventos.fct.unl.pt/papec) that's
    talks-only, with a talk proposal due date of January 27.  I might
    submit something to this as well.
