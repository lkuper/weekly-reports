# Weekly report, week 43 of 2013

Sorry this is three days late.  :(

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

All talk prep, all the time!

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

  * Lots of work on preparing for my RICON talk and my talk at PL Fest
    on Friday.
	
  * *Lots* of emails with the Berkeley people and Marek Zawirski,
    trying to sort out LVars/CRDTs/Bloom^L stuff.  (Relevant
    lattice-variables threads:
    https://groups.google.com/d/msg/lattice-variables/Vp9_c5KAR68/D6f6eoWXORYJ,
    https://groups.google.com/d/msg/lattice-variables/lRV14YUtjr4/TJ4lC-D1QpoJ,
    https://groups.google.com/d/msg/lattice-variables/MStY-KHNQk8/uxkUWZo8qCsJ)
  
  * Did some test refactoring for lvish issue #36
    (https://github.com/iu-parfunc/lvars/commit/463acb0).
	
  * Ryan and I did a new release of LVish, mostly to try to fix our
    busted Hackage docs; we did some minor cleanups (mainly getting
    rid of unneeded imports) along with it.
	
## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

  * After my talk, I got lots of feedback on my talk from Ryan and
    others and am working on improving it.
  
  * Our attempt to fix the Hackage docs didn't work (probably because
    the supposed fix hadn't been actually pushed to Hackage yet?), so
    we'll try again soon.
	
  * Jenkins is broken as usual. :(
  
## (4) What is your plan for next week?

  * Submitting my GED self-evaluation (today).

  * Attending a day-long Riak tutorial Monday.

  * Working on my talk some more today, speaking at RICON Tuesday and
    Mozilla Thursday.
	
  * All week: talking with people at RICON.  Maybe someone wants to
    join forces on an LVars + CRDTs paper?
  
## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

All the preparation I'm doing for these talks will feed into my
proposal as well. I'm also tentatively thinking about a spring paper
submission on CRDTs+LVars and am investigating possible venues for
such a paper.
