# Weekly report, week 42 of 2013

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

  * Finish reading the CRDT survey paper, maybe read one or two other
    papers from the list, and work on a blog post to try to synthesize
    all this.

  * Work on my RICON talk, which will also be my PL Fest talk for the
    25th, which I'm now also doing a version of at Mozilla on the 31st. :)

  * Read the "Monadic Abstract Interpreters" paper
    (http://ilyasergey.net/papers/monalysis-pldi13.pdf), write to Ilya
    and probably Matt Might about CFA stuff, update them on where
    LVish stands and what they can do with it.

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

  * Read the Shapiro et al. CRDT survey paper -- lots of good stuff in
    here.
  
  * Read the Amazon Dynamo paper -- perhaps less immediately relevant,
    but offers context for the above. (lattice-variables post:

  * Installed Erlang and Riak on the parfunc account so that we'll be
    able to play around with Riak and CRDTs in the near
    future. (lattice-variables post:

  * Scheduled my thesis proposal for November 21st! (!!!)
  
  * Making slow but perceptible progress on preparing for my talks;
    part of this talk prep is a giant "What's the deal with LVars and
    CRDTs?" blog post where I try to cover everything I know about it
    so far and what my plans are -- I'll get this posted by next week.
	
## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

  * I've been putting off the monadic abstract interpreters stuff
    because I've been so singleminded about the CRDT stuff -- I should
    probably at least shoot Ilya a quick message before everything we
    talked about at POPL is forgotten.
  
## (4) What is your plan for next week?

All talk prep, all the time.
  
## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

All the preparation I'm doing for these talks will feed into my
proposal as well. I'm also tentatively thinking about a spring paper
submission on CRDTs+LVars and am investigating possible venues for
such a paper.
