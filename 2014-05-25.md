# Weekly report, week 21 of 2014

(This actually covers a week and a half...I'm three days late in writing this.)

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

  (1) Write a dissertation outline, send it to my committee, see how
  everyone feels about me defending in late August. :)
  
  (2) Haskell Symposium reviews (I only have 6 to review).
  
  (3) Figure out what, if anything, I need to do before going to PLDI
  (get a one-minute presentation ready?).

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

Mostly worked on my Haskell Symposium reviews.  Got my one-minute PLDI
presentation ready.  Got a tentative defense date scheduled (August 29
with September 8 as a backup -- both seem to be OK with everyone).

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

Honestly haven't made much progress on dissertation outlining, due to
a bunch of personal stuff going on this week (such as practicing for
the wedding I'm singing in on Saturday!).  I'll see how I do next week
after the Haskell Symposium review deadline.
  
## (4) What is your plan for next week?

I'm on a road trip to Minneapa wedding the next three days and get back
Sunday the 1st, so I don't expect to get much work done during that
time.  Starting the 2nd I will be working on dissertation stuff, I
promise!

## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

My goal is to have a dissertation draft by mid-July.
