# Weekly report, week 19 of 2014

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

  * Get our paper in good shape to submit to DISC.

  * Work on a dissertation outline.

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

Spent all week working on the DISC paper, and I now have a draft that
I think is in reasonably good shape:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/6xvj76xnte2e0u0/disc14-draft.pdf -- except
that the proof needs to be entirely rewritten now that the statement
of Theorem 2 is entirely different.  So, I'll work on that next.  Ken
gave more feedback but declined my offer of co-authorship.

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

No problems, except I haven't gotten around to the dissertation
outline yet.  It may have to wait until I'm back from NYC on the 19th.
  
## (4) What is your plan for next week?

  * Finish up the proof for the DISC paper and get our DISC submission
    in on Thursday.

  * Leaving for NYC for !!Con on Thursday; will be gone until Monday
    the 19th.

## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

After the DISC deadline and !!Con I'll be working on dissertation
stuff and doing Haskell Symposium reviews for the rest of the month
(papers haven't been assigned yet but I think I'll have 8 or 10 papers
to review).
