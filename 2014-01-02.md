# Weekly report, week 1 of 2014

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

  * Get a rough draft of my WoDet submission done.
  
  * Try to sort out some of this `asyncAnd` stuff with Wren, if she
    has time.

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

WoDet submission in progress at
https://github.com/iu-parfunc/lvish_papers/tree/master/wodet14_crdts.
There's not much to it yet -- a lot of it is just a dump of the stuff
on CRDTs from my proposal -- but I expect to make a lot of progress on
it in the next week.

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

Just general mid-winter slothfulness interspersed with panic about
everything I have to do this month...
  
## (4) What is your plan for next week?

Continue working on my WoDet submission, due a week from tomorrow -- I
have some actual math yet to do, and I'll see how that goes tomorrow.

Look at and respond to Wren's email (and some of the comments on my
blog) about `asyncAnd`.

I also want to start doing some stuff with Naiad -- in particular I
want to read these posts
(http://bigdataatsvc.wordpress.com/2012/10/09/welcome-to-naiad/) and
try actually running some Naiad programs; if I can make it work on a
non-Windows platform, that is.  I think the stuff about fixpoint
computations smells like LVars, and it might help me figure out an
angle for the POPL/MSR talks.

## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

  * WoDet is due January 10; PaPEC (talks only:
    http://eventos.fct.unl.pt/papec/pages/welcome-papec) is due
    January 27.  PaPEC says: "We solicit proposals for contributed
    talks. We recommend preparing proposals of at most 2 pages, in
    either plain text or PDF format. However, we will accept longer
    proposals or submissions to other conferences, under the
    understanding that PC members are only expected to read the first
    two pages of such longer submissions."  So there's no reason not
    to send my WoDet submission to PaPEC too.
	
  * As soon as WoDet is over with (or sooner!) I need to work on my
    POPL talk and my MSR talk.
