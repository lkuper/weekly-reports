# Weekly report, week 5 of 2014

This covers everything since Friday the 24th.

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

  * Go to the last day of POPL and OBT on Saturday.

  * Work on my MSR talk; do a practice talk; visit MSR on Monday!
  
  * Lots of job-search-related stuff.
  
  * Start working on expanding the LVars/CRDTs paper into a conference
    paper.
  
  * I get back to Bloomington on Tuesday the 28th.

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

  * Went to the last day of POPL and OBT.
  
  * Did a practice MSR talk on Saturday and got lots of advice from
    Neel etc.; worked on my MSR slides all weekend.  (Final version:

  * Visited MSR on Monday!

  * More job searching/applying (need to email Ryan about this).
  
  * Thought of a good target for the LVars/CRDTs paper: CONCUR, due
    April 19th (http://concur2014.org/deadlines.php).
	
  * Did a blog post about our POPL paper, with code examples:

  * Just tonight, we found out that our Effect Zoo paper got into
    PLDI!!!  :D :D

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

No real problems, just the usual recovery period from travel.
  
## (4) What is your plan for next week?

  * We should get a PLDI artifact ready, shouldn't we?  Due Friday the
    7th, it looks like: http://pldi14-aec.cs.brown.edu/

  * More job search stuff.

  * We hear back about the LVars/CRDTs WoDet paper tomorrow.
  
  * Redex stuff I want to work on: semantics for threshold functions;
    semantics for `bump`.  Also maybe see about doing a Redex model
    for CRDTs -- that is, actually model replicated objects.
  
## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

  * Job search stuff is part of my long-term plan of "get a job". :)

  * Redex stuff: `bump` would be part of the LVars/CRDTs paper (idea:
    CRDTs allow general inflationary writes, so why shouldn't we?).
    Same goes for modeling replicated objects.  The threshold function
    semantics thing is something I just ought to spend some time on to
    try to understand better anyway.
