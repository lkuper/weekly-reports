# Weekly report, week 36 (counting down, rather than up)

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

  * A long-delayed editing pass over the LVish quasi-determinism
    proof.
  
  * Work on understanding the LVish implementation
    (https://github.com/iu-parfunc/lvars/tree/master/haskell-prototype)
    better so that I can more effectively hack on it/talk about it.
    (Until now it's mostly been Ryan and Aaron Turon's work.)

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

  * Fixed up the parts of the proof that I was most worried about.
    Left TODOs in the file for the rest.  Details in a
    lattice-variables thread:
    https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/lattice-variables/XL7spDkqBQk
	
  * Idle musings about interpreting LVar effects as resources.
    Blogged:
    http://composition.al/blog/2013/08/30/interpreting-lvar-effects-as-resources/
	
  * Finally reading the monad-par paper with an eye toward better
    understanding the LVish implementation, which is based on
    monad-par.  (I'll have questions about this sooner or later...)

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

  * TBH I'm still intimidated by much of the LVish implementation and
    don't really know any way around this other than "dive in".

## (4) What is your plan for next week?

  * Prepare for and give a talk on Friday at pl-wonks.  This will be
    my FHPC practice talk, so it won't really be new material for
    anyone who's already seen me talk about LVars.
	
  * Work on our POPL review rebuttal for the LVish paper the 10th-13th!
	
  * Practice using the LVish implementation by implementing some more
    graph algorithms.  I might try doing parallel topological sorting
    because I want to see how LVars do with that.

## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

  * The talk is necessary practice for FHPC on the 23rd.
  
  * The review rebuttal is a necessary evil if we want a shot at POPL!
    :)

  * I want to get better at working with the implementation for its
    own sake, but also, we'll likely end up resubmitting the LVish
    paper to PLDI, and if so, we'll want more benchmarks and/or case
    studies anyway.
