# Weekly report, week 29 of 2014

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

- Work on the proof refactoring that Neel suggested; this will affect
  chapters 2 and 3.

- Get chapter 4 into readable shape.

- Work on the missing "generalizing `put` and `get`" section in
  Chapter 2.

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

My plan to get work done while moving was way too ambitious. :(
However, I did get some work done on the proof refactoring suggested
by Neel.  It's maybe half finished in chapter 2.  This is happening in
a branch called "split-semantics"
(https://github.iu.edu/lkuper/dissertation/commits/split-semantics).

I also made some progress on Chapter 4, although not enough to get it
into readable shape yet.

I didn't yet get any work done on the missing section in Chapter 2.

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

Mainly just that moving is a lot of work. :( However, we're now in
Sunnyvale, and I plan to get some work done in between unpacking!

## (4) What is your plan for next week?

Everything that I didn't get done last week: keep working on the
split-semantics proof refactoring, get chapter 4 into readable shape,
and work on the missing section in chapter 2.

Also, I'm resubmitting our DISC submission to OPODIS (abstract due the
23rd, paper due the 30th).  I plan to make some minor changes to
address some of the points made by the DISC reviewers, but there won't
be time to do any more than that, plus reformatting.  (Specifically,
one of the reviewers had a technical misunderstanding about infinite
threshold sets, showing that we need to be more clear about threshold
sets and that they should be understood as a semantic modeling tool,
not an implementation technique.)

## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

It's becoming clear that I won't make my deadline of the 25th for a
dissertation draft, so now I'm going for the end of July -- although
that might slip as well.  I hope it slips by no more than a week.
