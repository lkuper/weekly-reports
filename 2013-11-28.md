# Weekly report, week 48 of 2013

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

  * Get the first draft of my thesis proposal sent out to my committee
    Friday.

  * Go back and revisit the buggy join function (and things like it
    that I've tried to do in the past) and try to figure out a way to
    either have our cake and eat it too, or to prove that doing so is
    not possible.  (If short-circuit threshold sets and associativity
    of join aren't possible to have at the same time, then that might
    be the motivation I finally need to understand what the deal is
    with so-called "threshold functions" as a more general alternative
    to threshold sets.  I've always been very fuzzy on what threshold
    functions would mean formally and what properties would be
    required of them.)
	
  * Learn about dotted version vectors
    (http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.5808) so I can understand how CRDTs are
    implemented in Riak.

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

  * I got the first draft of my proposal sent out Friday (well, 4am
    Saturday -- close enough!)  and a second, hopefully final draft
    sent today (with revisions to the CRDT stuff):
    https://www.cs.indiana.edu/~lkuper/papers/thesis-proposal.pdf
	
  * After thinking some more about "high-water-mark" threshold reads
    on CRDTs, I decided that maybe it wasn't that great of an idea
    (https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/lattice-variables/YWrzQieqGZY).
	
  * Russell from Basho wrote back with some thoughts about use cases
    for threshold reads in CRDTs, and I responded to that
    (https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/lattice-variables/09nhZZfVhdM).
	
## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

I still haven't have time to think much about the buggy short-circuit
join function, threshold functions, etc., nor about dotted version
vectors, and all this will have to wait until the week after next...

## (4) What is your plan for next week?

I'll be out of town volunteering at Hacker School all week and won't
be doing much research, although I might fit a blog post in.

## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

  * My proposal is still scheduled for December 6.

  * I'm going to try targeting WoDet (http://wodet.cs.washington.edu/)
    for a paper about CRDTs+LVars (more details will be in my
    proposal) -- deadline of January 10.  This wouldn't preclude
    submitting a longer version to ICFP (deadline March 1) if it turns
    out I have enough to say on the topic.

  * There's also a new workshop on "Principles and Practice of
    Eventual Consistency" (http://eventos.fct.unl.pt/papec) that's
    talks-only, with a talk proposal due date of January 27.  I might
    submit something to this as well.
