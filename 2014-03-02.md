# Weekly report, week 9 of 2014

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

  * Read over people's ICFP submissions.

  * Finish getting my WoDet talk ready.
    
  * Redex, dammit.
  
  * Not really research, but: various admitted-student-visit activities.
  
  * Leaving for SLC on the 1st.

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

  * Read and gave feedback on Sam's ICFP paper.
  
  * Lots of work on my WoDet talk.  Final version:
    https://www.cs.indiana.edu/~lkuper/talks/monotonic-determinism/wodet-2014.pdf
  
  * Some WIP on adding support for `bump` in the lambdaLVish Redex model:
    https://github.com/iu-parfunc/lvars/commit/ca9cfe691646663ec1325a5626833c71e3af69bd
	
  * Lots of admitted-student-visit activities.
	
  * Went to WoDet, gave my talk, talked with lots of people.

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

None!
  
## (4) What is your plan for next week?

  * Hang out at ASPLOS and go to talks Monday.

  * Give a talk at Utah on Tuesday.
  
  * More Redexing.
  
  * Back in Bloomington late Wednesday.  Ryan, Sam, and I should meet
    and talk about what we need to do for our PLDI camera-ready due
    the 20th.
  
  * Figure out if I really want to go for CONCUR.  The page limit is
	rather short, and the conference overlaps with ICFP... :/
  
## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

  * The Redex `bump` stuff is for an eventual full LVars/CRDTs paper.
    Or maybe it'll be part of an eventual LVars journal paper?  In any
    case, we should formalize `bump`.
