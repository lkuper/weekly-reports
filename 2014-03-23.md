# Weekly report, week 12 of 2014

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

  * Incorporate various suggestions into my Intel talk.  Figure out
    who I'm going to be speaking with there.
  
  * Read the paper(s) that Steve gave me
    (http://netdb.cis.upenn.edu/papers/lam-psnCor.pdf and perhaps also
    http://thinkinginmeta.com/Fan/pdf/metaprogramming_for_ocaml.pdf).
    Skype with him, Boon, and Ras on Wednesday.
	  
  * Finish up our PLDI camera-ready, due Thursday!

  * Headed to California on Thursday afternoon; interview Friday; back
    Saturday.

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

  * All of the above, except that we got an extension on our PLDI
    camera-ready until the 31st.  Yay!

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

No problems.  Things went pretty well at Intel -- I sent a separate
email to Ryan about that.
  
## (4) What is your plan for next week?

Spending the whole week on "vacation" (well, sort of) at Hacker School
-- back in Bloomington on Friday the 28th.
  
## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

Vacations are important! :)
